# Module 5

# Please use FireFox web browser when testing this assignment, 
# as it has a more lenient CORS policy than Google Chrome.

# If the index.html page is still loading with CORS policy errors,
# make sure to change your "privacy.file_unique_origin" property to FALSE
# by navigating in your FireFox browser to url "about:config" and toggling
# the "privacy.file_unique_origin" property to FALSE
